# Load packages
packages <- c('tidyverse', 'janitor')
lapply(packages, function(package) library(package, character.only = TRUE))
```

## Introduction
This dataset looks at the names, ages, and marriages of various 'kings' and 'consorts', spanning 850 AD to the modern day.


```{r cars}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2024-08-20')
data <- tuesdata$english_monarchs_marriages_df
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
